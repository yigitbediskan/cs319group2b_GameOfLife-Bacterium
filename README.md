# Game of Life: <i>Bacterium</i>

This program is an imitation of the single celled livings' evolution process. We aim to bring the concepts related to  evolution closer by offering visual cues for mutation, carbon cycle, genetic code  etc. 

At the start of the application there will be random creatures all around the ecosystem, that is, the cells will have genetic code assigned to them in a random fashion. The genetic code will be cued to the user by line segments with different colors that represent different genes. The cells will have genes featuring attack power, which will deal damage to other cells, rate of prolifiration, amount of O2 released or CO2 consumed, rate of mutation, the angles between the segments of the cell, health point, symmetrical properties etc. 
The cells will float around in a random fashion and upon contacting with a different cell, their attacking segments will inflict damage to the opponents, while their defending segments are tested for fitness. After achieving certain health point they will begin prolifirate, thus ensuring survival of the fittest rule. The user will be able to change the CO2 ratio of the ecosystem, the genetic code of the cells at will. There will also be statistics about the conditions of the different species.
User will be able to add random creatures all around or remove them. The most populus ones will be saved for future battles.
